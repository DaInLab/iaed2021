# Contributing

Like *R for Data Science*, the solutions to it have been developed in the open, and they can improve with your contributions. There are a number of ways you can help make the solutions even better:

-   If you don't understand something, please
    [let me know](mailto:jeffrey.arnold@gmail.com). Your feedback on what is confusing or hard to understand is valuable.

-   If you spot a typo, feel free to edit the underlying page and send a pull
    request. If you've never done this before, the process is very easy:

    -   Click the edit this page on the sidebar.

    -   Make the changes using GitHub's in-page editor and save.

    -   Submit a pull request and include a brief description of your changes.
        "Fixing typos" is perfectly adequate.
