```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, cache = TRUE)
```

The chunk `a` has no dependencies.
```{r a}
print(lubridate::now())
x <- 1
```

The chunk `b` depends on `a`.
```{r b, dependson = c("a")}
print(lubridate::now())
y <- x + 1
```

The chunk `c` depends on `a`.
```{r c, dependson = c("a")}
print(lubridate::now())
z <- x * 2
```

The chunk `d` depends on `c` and `b`:
```{r d, dependson = c("c", "b")}
print(lubridate::now())
w <- y + z
```

If this document is knit repeatedly, the value  printed by `lubridate::now()` 
will be the same for all chunks, and the same as the first time the document
was run with caching.
